# Multi-Class Text Classification

This repository contains my solution for a Kaggle competition on **multi-class classification of customer reviews** for an e-commerce clothing store.

### Key points:
- Built **deep learning NLP models** (with embeddings and optimization) to classify customer feedback into categories.  
- Applied **text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning**.  

 See the notebook for full code and comments.
